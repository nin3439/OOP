# Encapsulation
**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, known as a class. The main goal of encapsulation is to hide the internal implementation details of an object and only expose a well-defined public interface through which other parts of the code can interact with the object. This concept is often summarized with the phrase "data hiding."

Encapsulation provides several benefits:

**1. Modularity**: By encapsulating related data and behavior within a class, you create a self-contained module that can be reused and maintained independently.

**2. Data Protection**: By making the internal data private (or protected), you prevent unauthorized access and modification from outside the class, ensuring data integrity and security.

**3. Code Flexibility**: Encapsulation allows you to change the internal implementation of a class without affecting the code that uses the class, as long as the public interface remains unchanged.

Now, let's see an example of encapsulation in TypeScript:

```
class BankAccount {
  private accountNumber: string;
  private balance: number;

  constructor(accountNumber: string, initialBalance: number) {
    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    this.balance = initialBalance;
  }

  public getAccountNumber(): string {
    return this.accountNumber;
  }

  public getBalance(): number {
    return this.balance;
  }

  public deposit(amount: number): void {
    this.balance += amount;
    console.log(`Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${this.balance}`);
  }

  public withdraw(amount: number): void {
    if (this.balance >= amount) {
      this.balance -= amount;
      console.log(`Withdrawn ${amount}. New balance: ${this.balance}`);
    } else {
      console.log("Insufficient balance");
    }
  }
}
```
In this example, we have a BankAccount class that represents a simple bank account. The class has two private properties: accountNumber and balance. These properties are marked as private, so they are not accessible from outside the class. This ensures that other parts of the code cannot directly access or modify these properties.

To interact with the private properties, the class provides public methods: getAccountNumber, getBalance, deposit, and withdraw. These methods serve as the public interface through which other parts of the code can interact with the BankAccount object.

Now, let's use this class:

```
const account = new BankAccount("123456789", 1000);

console.log("Account Number:", account.getAccountNumber()); // Output: "Account Number: 123456789"
console.log("Balance:", account.getBalance()); // Output: "Balance: 1000"

account.deposit(500); // Output: "Deposited 500. New balance: 1500"
account.withdraw(200); // Output: "Withdrawn 200. New balance: 1300"
account.withdraw(1500); // Output: "Insufficient balance"
```
In this usage example, we can see that we can access the account number and balance through the public methods, but we cannot directly modify them. This is due to the encapsulation, which protects the internal state of the BankAccount object and allows controlled access through the defined public interface.

By encapsulating the data within the class and providing well-defined methods to interact with it, we ensure that the state of the object remains consistent and secure, making the code easier to maintain and less prone to bugs or accidental misuse.
