# Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** is another important concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface (method or property) to represent different types of objects, providing flexibility and extensibility to the codebase. Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

There are two types of polymorphism:

Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism): This type of polymorphism is resolved at compile time. It occurs when the method overloading is used, i.e., having multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. The compiler determines the appropriate method to call based on the method's signature and the arguments passed during the function call.

Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism): This type of polymorphism is resolved at run time. It occurs when the method overriding is used, i.e., having a method in the subclass with the same name and signature as the one in the superclass. The method to be called is determined at run time based on the actual type of the object.

Let's illustrate both types of polymorphism with an example:

```
// Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
class MathOperations {
  add(a: number, b: number): number;
  add(a: string, b: string): string;
  add(a: any, b: any): any {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const math = new MathOperations();
console.log(math.add(5, 10)); // Output: 15 (number addition)
console.log(math.add("Hello, ", "World!")); // Output: "Hello, World!" (string concatenation)

// Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
class Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Some generic sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
}

function animalSound(animal: Animal) {
  animal.makeSound();
}

const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

animalSound(dog); // Output: "Woof!" (Dog's sound)
animalSound(cat); // Output: "Meow!" (Cat's sound)

```
In this example, we first demonstrate compile-time polymorphism through method overloading in the MathOperations class. We define two versions of the add method: one for number addition and another for string concatenation. The appropriate method is chosen at compile time based on the argument types used during the function call.

Next, we demonstrate run-time polymorphism through method overriding in the Animal, Dog, and Cat classes. The Animal class has a makeSound method that provides a generic sound. Both the Dog and Cat classes override the makeSound method to provide their specific sounds. When we call the animalSound function with different objects of Dog and Cat, the appropriate makeSound method is dynamically determined at run time based on the actual object's type.

Polymorphism allows you to write more flexible and extensible code by treating objects based on their common interface rather than their specific types. It plays a crucial role in designing large-scale applications and simplifies the interactions between various classes and modules.
