# Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** is another important concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface (method or property) to represent different types of objects, providing flexibility and extensibility to the codebase. Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

Let's illustrate polymorphism with an example:

```
class Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Some generic sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
}

function animalSound(animal: Animal) {
  animal.makeSound();
}

const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

animalSound(dog); // Output: "Woof!" (Dog's sound)
animalSound(cat); // Output: "Meow!" (Cat's sound)

```
In this example, we demonstrate polymorphism through method overriding in the Animal, Dog, and Cat classes. The Animal class has a makeSound method that provides a generic sound. Both the Dog and Cat classes override the makeSound method to provide their specific sounds. When we call the animalSound function with different objects of Dog and Cat, the appropriate makeSound method is dynamically determined at run time based on the actual object's type.

Polymorphism allows you to write more flexible and extensible code by treating objects based on their common interface rather than their specific types. It plays a crucial role in designing large-scale applications and simplifies the interactions between various classes and modules.

To demonstrate polymorphism in TypeScript, let's create a new example that involves a Vehicle class and two subclasses, Car and Bicycle, each with their own implementation of a startEngine method. This example will illustrate how polymorphism allows us to treat objects of different classes in a uniform manner, as demonstrated by the startVehicle function.

```

// Base class
class Vehicle {
 startEngine() {
    console.log("The engine starts.");
 }
}

// Subclass 1
class Car extends Vehicle {
 startEngine() {
    console.log("The car engine starts with a roar.");
 }
}

// Subclass 2
class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
 startEngine() {
    console.log("The bicycle engine starts with a click.");
 }
}

// Function to demonstrate polymorphism
function startVehicle(vehicle: Vehicle) {
 vehicle.startEngine();
}

// Creating instances of subclasses
const myCar = new Car();
const myBicycle = new Bicycle();

// Using the function with different types of vehicles
startVehicle(myCar); // Output: "The car engine starts with a roar."
startVehicle(myBicycle); // Output: "The bicycle engine starts with a click."

```
In this example, the Vehicle class serves as the base class, and Car and Bicycle are subclasses that extend Vehicle. Each subclass overrides the startEngine method to provide its own implementation. The startVehicle function accepts an object of type Vehicle, allowing it to work with any object that extends Vehicle, demonstrating polymorphism. When we pass instances of Car and Bicycle to startVehicle, it calls the appropriate startEngine method for each, showcasing how polymorphism enables us to use objects of different classes interchangeably in a type-safe manner.
