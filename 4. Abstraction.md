# Abstraction
**Abstraction** is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on presenting essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It allows you to represent complex systems or entities in a simplified manner, making it easier to understand and work with them. Abstraction enables you to build models that capture the relevant characteristics of an object, without exposing all the implementation specifics.

In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. These abstract constructs provide a blueprint for other classes to follow, defining a set of methods and properties without providing their implementation. The concrete subclasses that extend the abstract class or implement the interface are responsible for implementing these abstract elements.

The main benefits of abstraction are:

**1. Simplified Complexity**: Abstraction allows you to focus on the high-level design and behavior of an object, hiding the intricate details that might not be relevant at that level.

**2. Code Reusability**: By defining common interfaces through abstract classes or interfaces, you promote code reuse. Concrete classes can inherit from an abstract class or implement an interface, inheriting its structure and behavior.

**3. Flexibility**: Abstraction enables you to change the implementation details of concrete classes without affecting the overall functionality of the program, as long as the abstract interface remains unchanged.

Let's illustrate abstraction with an example:

```
// Abstract class representing a shape
abstract class Shape {
  abstract getArea(): number;
  abstract getPerimeter(): number;
}

// Concrete subclass representing a Circle
class Circle extends Shape {
  private radius: number;

  constructor(radius: number) {
    super();
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  getArea(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }

  getPerimeter(): number {
    return 2 * Math.PI * this.radius;
  }
}

// Concrete subclass representing a Rectangle
class Rectangle extends Shape {
  private width: number;
  private height: number;

  constructor(width: number, height: number) {
    super();
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  getArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }

  getPerimeter(): number {
    return 2 * (this.width + this.height);
  }
}

```
In this example, we have an abstract class called Shape. It defines two abstract methods: getArea() and getPerimeter(). These methods represent the essential characteristics of any shape, but they are not implemented in the Shape class itself.

Then, we have two concrete subclasses, Circle and Rectangle, that extend the Shape class. These subclasses are responsible for providing implementations for the abstract methods.

By using abstraction, we can create a collection of different shapes and calculate their areas and perimeters without worrying about the specific implementation details of each shape:
```
function printShapeDetails(shape: Shape) {
  console.log("Area:", shape.getArea());
  console.log("Perimeter:", shape.getPerimeter());
}

const circle = new Circle(5);
const rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);

printShapeDetails(circle);
printShapeDetails(rectangle);

```
When we run this code, we get the following output:

```
Area: 78.53981633974483
Perimeter: 31.41592653589793
Area: 24
Perimeter: 20

```
The beauty of abstraction is that the printShapeDetails function can work with any shape that implements the Shape interface. We can create new shapes, such as triangles, squares, etc., without modifying the Shape class or the printShapeDetails function. This demonstrates the flexibility and reusability achieved through abstraction.
